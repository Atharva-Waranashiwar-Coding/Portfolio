When I started my Master's journey at Northeastern University, I knew a co-op would be a part of the experience. But I didn't fully realize how transformative it would be — until now.
In January 2025, I joined 10th Inning Ventures as a Software Engineering Co-op. From the very first week, I wasn’t treated like an intern. I was treated like a real engineer — expected to design, build, debug, and deliver like any full-time team member.

## Real-World Problem Solving

I worked on an Athlete Management Platform that included facility booking, athlete profiles, AI coaching, and real-time task tracking. Technologies like React, Firebase, FastAPI, and Google Cloud Platform were no longer "things I knew" — they became **tools I lived**.
Deadlines were real. Client needs were real. Every decision had an impact.  
And every success, no matter how small, felt 10x more rewarding because it solved a **real** problem.

## Learning To Navigate Ambiguity

One of the biggest lessons wasn’t technical — it was learning how to deal with ambiguity. Unlike academic projects, industry problems often start vague. Clear documentation? Doesn't always exist. Perfect requirements? Rare.  
I learned to ask better questions, take initiative, and iterate fast.

## Looking Ahead

As I wrap up the first few months of my co-op, I realize that growth doesn’t just happen by learning more technologies — it happens by **owning the problem, not just the code**.

And this is just the beginning.
