# From Dreaming to Doing: How Working on My Co-op Changed Me

April 2025 marks four months into my co-op journey. If I had to summarize it in one line, it would be: **"Execution beats everything."**

Before starting real-world work, it was easy to dream. Dream about building massive systems, learning every technology, being a "full-stack wizard."  
But dreams don't ship products. **Doing does.**

## Lessons Beyond Code

I realized that what makes an engineer valuable isn't just the ability to write code. It's the ability to:
- Understand the "why" behind a feature
- Communicate effectively across teams
- Deliver consistently, even under uncertainty
- Prioritize progress over perfection

At 10th Inning Ventures, I worked on projects that started as rough ideas and turned them into deployed, user-facing features. I made mistakes, asked for help, debugged till midnight — and grew every single day.

## Personal Growth

Outside of coding, the co-op experience taught me resilience.  
Some days were smooth, some days were frustrating. Some designs worked, some flopped.  
But showing up every day — willing to improve, willing to learn — that changed me.

It made me realize: **You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be relentless.**

## Moving Forward

As I move toward the end of my co-op term, I feel a strange excitement.  
Not because everything is easy now — but because I know that whatever comes next, I'll be ready.

Because now, I’m not just dreaming.  
**I’m doing.**
